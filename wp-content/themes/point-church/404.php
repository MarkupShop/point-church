			<p class="scripture">The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. <br/><br/>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. <br /><br/>Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”
